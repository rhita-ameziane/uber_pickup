# Analysis of uber pickups in the city of New York

One of the painpoints of every for hire vehicle company like Uber, is that sometimes drivers are not around when people need them.
The goal of this project is to come up with solutions to this, aka, figuring out the hot zones in a specific city (here New York).

Data was collected from NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission after FiveThirtyEight submitted a Freedom of Information Law request on July 20, 2015 [1]. 
More recent data can be found on NY city website [2].
